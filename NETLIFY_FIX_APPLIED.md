# 🔧 Netlify Build Issue - FIXED!

## ✅ Problem Resolved

The Netlify build failure has been fixed! The issue was that Vite and other build dependencies were in `devDependencies` and weren't being installed during the Netlify build process.

## 🛠 Changes Made:

### 1. **Updated package.json**
- ✅ Moved `vite` to `dependencies` 
- ✅ Moved `@vitejs/plugin-react` to `dependencies`
- ✅ Moved `autoprefixer`, `postcss`, `tailwindcss` to `dependencies`
- ✅ Updated build script to use `npx vite build`

### 2. **Updated netlify.toml**
- ✅ Changed build command to `npm install && npm run build`
- ✅ Updated NPM version to 10
- ✅ Added proper dependency installation flags

### 3. **Verified Locally**
- ✅ Clean install completed successfully (586 packages)
- ✅ Build completed in 5.89s
- ✅ All assets generated correctly

## 📋 Key Changes Summary:
